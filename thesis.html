# Beyond the university:
## Mapping higher education after data science

A thesis proposal by [Cory Salveson](http://corysalveson.com)

---
# Questions
## 1. What **new institutional arrangements** are forming in higher education "online"?
## 2. What do these changes mean for **universities** and **knowledge**?

---
# Approach
.left-column[**Data Science** education has exploded in the last few years.

Many "degree" programs now appear online.

How are they different?]

.right-column[
- Cost? Who pays?
- Role of government, industry, academia?
- Pedagogy?
- Social mobility?
- Discourse?

### Structure: **comparative**
### Framing theory: **sociology of education** and **new institutional economics**
]

???
- Need to be able to structure and frame
- Sociology of education = how does education "work" in social reality, e.g. in relation to the state
  - Code (Bernstein)
  - Habitus/Field Theory (Bourdieu)
- NIE = how to arrangements of formal and informal rules, organizational formations, etc. develop; and what interests are expressed in how they are balanced
---
# Methodology
- Build **typology** of institutional forms for **comparative analysis**
- Model **network** of institutions to analyze specific **power relationships**?
- Discourse analysis?

# Data
- Dataset of all MOOCs offered since 2007.red[\*]
- Scraping public web: GitHub, MOOC websites, universities
- Policy and funding documents
- Probably scope to United States only

# Expected Results & Significance
<img src="./img/bigdata.png" width="50%" style="float:right; padding-left: 20px;" />
- Say something about a field of institutions and forces that haven't been studied together yet

- Suggest some things about the implications of the above for the future of knowledge

- Help sociology of education to *ride the big data wave*
