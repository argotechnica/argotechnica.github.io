<!-- # About Me -->

I’m a hands-on technology leader with a foundation in social science research and 15+ years of experience turning emerging tech into products that unlock human potential.

My work spans startups, enterprise, academia, and government, and I’ve led teams building everything from immersive XR platforms to collective intelligence systems and knowledge management tools.

My purpose is to use technology thoughtfully to help people learn, grow, and connect; to preserve knowledge and wisdom; and to build systems that enable individuals and teams to realize their full potential.

Whether building full-stack solutions for AI-driven R&D, architecting modern cloud infrastructure for global teams, or mentoring future leaders, I bring a strategic-operational balance that helps organizations deliver meaningful impact.
